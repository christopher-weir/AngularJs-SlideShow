AngularJs-SlideShow
===================

A dynamic slideshow / presentation gallery plugin for AngularJs.

I know slideshows / carousels are a dime a dozen. For a project I need a slideshow that behaved differently from the normal swipe left to right. I also needed one that would build and destroy slides on each iteration. So I built this. Demo to come.
